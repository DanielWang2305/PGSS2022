              " 'a wonderful little production. <br /><br />the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only \"has got all the polari\" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams\\' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master\\'s of comedy and his life. <br /><br />the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional \\'dream\\' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell\\'s murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.']"
